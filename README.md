# LB Teil B: Coworking-Space
This is a Coworking-Space Management System for Bookings and the Users implemented with Quarkus.

## Setup
First you need the project inside of a Dev Container. After that, I advise you to reload the window with Ctrl + Shift + P and "Reload Window". Now you should be good to go, assuming you have already installed Quarkus.

## Launch
In VS Code, Ctrl + Shift + P and then ">Debug Quarkus" should do the job.

## Testdata
The testdata can be passed through the TestDataService into the database. There are two users and a booking already implemented.
